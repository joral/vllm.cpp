# ROCm decode-graph capture — port the `vt::Backend` capture seam to hipGraph

**Row:** `BACKEND-ROCM` (backend-matrix, `ACTIVE`).
**Claim:** `CLAIM-ROCM-DECODE-GRAPH` (unclaimed at time of writing).
**Issue:** [#332](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/332), also carried in
the [roadmap intake table](../roadmap_v1.md) and owed in the PR body — the three
must agree.
**Base:** current `upstream/main`. The gfx1200 correctness record this spec
links, [rocm-gfx1200-m2-correctness.md](rocm-gfx1200-m2-correctness.md), is
already ON `main` — it landed with #273's commits, so there is nothing left to
stack on and no dangling link.
**Anchors are SYMBOLS, not line numbers, and that is deliberate.** `main` runs
75-207 commits/day (measured over 2026-08-07..11), so a `file:line` anchor is
wrong within days: an earlier draft of this spec drifted +4 lines in
`cuda_backend.cu`, +7 in `backend.h`, and `rocm_ops.hip`'s `kPagedAttention`
registration moved 92 -> 148, all inside one day. Every anchor below is instead
a function signature, a `RegisterOp` call, a test-case title or a distinctive
comment — things `grep -rn` still finds after a thousand commits. Keep it that
way when editing.
**Board:** AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT (`gfx1200`, Navi 44, RDNA4, discrete), ROCm
7.2.3, hipClang/Clang 22.0.0 — the only board with hardware access here. Records
say gfx1200 and must not imply the four #41 boards
(gfx1151/gfx1103/gfx1100/gfx1201) are covered.

## 1. Why this, and what it is worth

`vt::Backend`'s graph-capture virtuals are implemented only for CUDA.
`SupportsGraphCapture()` is false on ROCm — the `stays FALSE` scope note in
`rocm_backend.hip` says so explicitly — and `RocmPlatform` does not override
`support_static_graph_mode()`, inheriting false from `interface.h`.
Decode-graph classes gate on both (the `enabled =` gate in
`Qwen3DenseDecodeGraph::Impl`), so every ROCm decode step pays full host launch
cost while vLLM on the same board replays captured hipGraphs.

Measured on gfx1200, 2026-08-10, 128in/128out batch 8, ours
(`examples/vllm-bench` on `build-hip`) vs a real vLLM-ROCm oracle at this
project's pin `555967922` in production config (**not** `--enforce-eager`):

| Model | Layers | hidden x inter | Ours | Oracle | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-0.6B | 28 | 1024 x 3072 | 184.69 tok/s | 552.65 tok/s | 2.99x |
| Qwen3-1.7B | 28 | 2048 x 6144 | 150.50 tok/s | 286.42 tok/s | 1.90x |
| Qwen3-4B | 36 | 2560 x 9728 | 98.49 tok/s | 143.36 tok/s | 1.46x |

Single-stream agrees: our TPOT 13.55 -> 24.09 -> 42.31 ms, oracle 5.21 ->
12.34 -> 27.13 ms/token, ratio 2.60x -> 1.95x -> 1.56x.

**The premise was tested by a scaling experiment before any code, and it
survived.** Launch overhead is fixed per decode step; compute is not. A
launch-dominated gap must shrink as compute per step grows; a
kernel-quality-dominated one must not. Across a 7.9x span of per-step compute
the gap falls monotonically **2.99x -> 1.90x -> 1.46x**.

The 0.6B/1.7B pair is the cleanest control: identical layer count (28), so an
identical launch count per step, with ~4x the compute. Qwen3-4B's 36 layers look
like a confound but are not — launches and compute both scale with layers, so
the layer count cancels and `L/C` depends only on per-layer width
(`1 / (hidden x intermediate)`). All three sit on one curve.

**It also bounds the win.** Fitting `ratio = alpha + beta / (hidden x inter)`
across the three points gives **alpha ~= 1.36x** (size-independent: kernel
quality, inductor fusion, the Triton attention path) and **beta ~= 1.65** in
units where 0.6B's `hidden x inter` = 1 — an overhead contribution of ~1.65x at
0.6B, ~0.41x at 1.7B, ~0.21x at 4B. So roughly half the 0.6B gap is fixed
overhead, and the expected outcome is all three sizes converging on **~1.36x**:
a real win, and **not parity**. A ~1.4x residual would remain.

Treat the fit as provisional. An earlier two-point version gave `alpha ~= 1.54x`;
Qwen3-4B then measured 1.46x, below that asymptote, which a curve cannot do, so
the third point forced the refit. The form is approximate — predicted vs measured
is 3.01/2.99, 1.77/1.90, 1.57/1.46 — `hidden x inter` is a proxy for per-step
compute rather than a measurement of it, and no trace has been taken on either
side. D4 carries this.

**Structural reason, independent of the numbers.** The capture virtuals
(`SupportsGraphCapture` through `DestroyGraph`, `include/vt/backend.h`) are
documented as a multi-backend seam ("CUDA Graphs / Metal ICB / Vulkan CB"), but
CUDA is the only implementation: Metal (`metal_backend.mm`), Vulkan
(`vulkan_backend.cpp`) and ROCm all carry the same `stays FALSE` note. A
one-implementation abstraction is unproven. hipGraph is the cheapest available
second, since `MTLIndirectCommandBuffer` and a pre-recorded `VkCommandBuffer`
are genuinely different models.

*Provenance.* Stock upstream checkpoints, SHA-256-verified against HF blob
hashes: `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`, `Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B` (`169ad53e...30ed5` /
`912becff...deff9`), `Qwen/Qwen3-4B` (`328a91d3...51223` / `6cd087b3...21ca5` /
`e4bf4369...f4ca1`). 4B needs `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.85` on the oracle
side (~8.0 GB weights + ~3 GB captured graphs against 15.92 GiB). Oracle =
`vllm bench throughput` / `latency` in the
`vllm-rocm-oracle:555967922-gfx1200` container (recipe in
[rocm-gfx1200-m2-correctness.md](rocm-gfx1200-m2-correctness.md)). Single run per
cell on a board that also drives a display: indicative, and **not** the
2-3x-reproduced-idle standard gate 5 requires. `Qwen/Qwen3-8B` does not fit
(~16.4 GB bf16 against 15.92 GiB), and no quantized path is available — ROCm
registers 44 ops to CUDA's 84, none of them quantized, and a discrete board has
no reference tier, so an unregistered op throws.

## 2. Scope

**In scope.**
1. `src/vt/rocm/rocm_backend.hip` — the six capture virtuals against hipGraph,
   mirroring `cuda_backend.cu`'s capture block, replacing the `stays FALSE`
   note.
2. `src/vllm/platforms/rocm.cpp` — add the `support_static_graph_mode()`
   override (`rocm.cpp` today only *comments* on the
   inherited false; there is no override).
3. `tests/vt/test_rocm_backend.cpp` — a RED-first capture/replay case (§6).
4. Records: this spec, the roadmap intake row, `backend-matrix.md`, and
   `docs/ROCM.md` §5's M3 text.

**Out of scope.**
- **New decode-graph model siblings.** Only models that already have one
  benefit; writing more is separate work with its own correctness gate.
- **`VT_BENCH_PROFILE_CONTROL`** (the `#ifdef` block inside `ReplayGraph`) —
  CUDA-profiler instrumentation, not load-bearing. A `rocprofiler` equivalent is
  later work; the first cut omits it and says so in the code.
- **Any model-level edit.** Every decode-graph class already gates generically
  with no `is_cuda()` anywhere — the identical `enabled =` gate across
  `qwen3.cpp`, `qwen3_moe.cpp`, `deepseek_v2.cpp`, `voxtral.cpp` and
  `qwen3_5.cpp` (`grep -rn support_static_graph_mode
  src/vllm/model_executor/models/`). Flipping the two flags suffices; needing a
  model edit would mean the seam had failed.
- **Metal / Vulkan capture.** Different APIs, different specs.
- **The M3 attention-backend NAME registration** (`get_attn_backend_priority`
  returns `{}`) and the stale `rocm.cpp` comment claiming `kPagedAttention` is
  unregistered for `kROCM` — it is registered (`RegisterOp(OpId::kPagedAttention,
  DeviceType::kROCM, ...)` in `rocm_ops.hip`) and ran `vt-native` on this board.
  Both real, both separate; a bug found in passing gets its own issue.

## 3. Upstream chain

**No upstream analog.** Graph capture in vLLM is torch's
(`CompilationConfig.cudagraph_mode`); there is no `csrc/` file to port. The
`vt::Backend` capture seam is an additive abstraction, same class as the ROCm
`hipMallocManaged` decision (`rocm-unified-memory-b.md`), and goes in the porting
inventory as additive with this spec as its record.

What is mirrored is upstream's *behaviour*: vLLM on ROCm captures hipGraphs by
default in production config, the configuration our gate measures against.
Observed on this board 2026-08-10 — 51 piecewise + 35 full captures, ~6 s, in the
`vllm bench` log — so "hipGraph capture works on gfx1200/ROCm 7.2.3" is measured,
not inferred.

Internal anchors:
- `SupportsGraphCapture` through `DestroyGraph` (`include/vt/backend.h`) — the
  six virtuals and the multi-backend comment.
- `Backend::BeginCapture` .. `Backend::DestroyGraph` (`src/vt/backend.cpp`) —
  base impls: five `VT_CHECK(false, ...)` throws, `DestroyGraph` a no-op. An
  unimplemented backend fails loudly; the model-level `enabled` gate keeps it
  off the path.
- the `--- CUDA-graph capture/replay` block (`src/vt/cuda/cuda_backend.cu`) —
  the implementation to mirror. Its capture-contract comment above
  `BeginCapture` is the real specification of what a caller must honour.
- `Platform::support_static_graph_mode()` — declared in
  `src/vllm/platforms/interface.h`, overridden true in `cuda.cpp`, and left to
  the inherited false in `rocm.cpp` (with a comment saying why).
- `Qwen3DenseDecodeGraph::Impl` (`src/vllm/model_executor/models/qwen3.cpp`) —
  the consumer: per-padded-size `SizeSlot`s with fixed-address persistent
  buffers, `Refresh()` in place, invalidate-and-recapture on a block-table
  column change.

## 4. Our baseline

**Reused as-is** — most of the change's value is that none of this is written:
the whole `vt::Backend` interface (no signature changes); every decode-graph
class and its capture-contract handling (padded slots, pre-warm, persistent
buffers, column-change invalidation); the `CUDA backend: graph capture/replay
re-executes captured ops` case in `test_cuda_backend.cpp` as the test
shape; the `tests/CMakeLists.txt` pattern that compiles
`test_rocm_backend.cpp` everywhere as a bit-rot guard but links it only under
`VLLM_CPP_HIP`.

**New:** the `hip*` graph calls. Mechanically a near-copy, but never compiled
here.

## 5. Port map

| CUDA (`cuda_backend.cu`) | ROCm (`rocm_backend.hip`) |
|---|---|
| `SupportsGraphCapture()` | same |
| `BeginCapture` — `cudaStreamBeginCapture(s, cudaStreamCaptureModeThreadLocal)` | `hipStreamBeginCapture(s, hipStreamCaptureModeThreadLocal)` |
| `EndCapture` — end → destroy prior `exec_` → instantiate → destroy graph | `hipStreamEndCapture` / `hipGraphExecDestroy` / `hipGraphInstantiate` / `hipGraphDestroy` |
| `Replay` — `cudaGraphLaunch(exec_, s)` | `hipGraphLaunch` |
| `EndCaptureGraph` — opaque-handle variant for the multi-size slot map | same shape; returns `hipGraphExec_t` as `void*` |
| `ReplayGraph(q, graph)` | same, minus `VT_BENCH_PROFILE_CONTROL` (§2) |
| `DestroyGraph` | `hipGraphExecDestroy` |
| `platforms/cuda.cpp` `support_static_graph_mode()` | new override in `platforms/rocm.cpp` |

Every name is a long-stable HIP runtime API with the same signature and
semantics as its CUDA counterpart — the property that lets upstream compile
`csrc/` for both through hipify.

## 6. Tests — RED first, and the right red

Nothing to port. One new case in `tests/vt/test_rocm_backend.cpp`, mirroring the
`CUDA backend: graph capture/replay re-executes captured ops` case in
`test_cuda_backend.cpp`, HIP-header-free like the rest of that file
(every assertion through public `vt::` seams; needing a HIP header would mean the
seam leaks):

1. `SupportsGraphCapture()` is true.
2. Allocate `src`/`dst` once — fixed pointers, per the capture contract. Load
   `src` with pattern A before capture.
3. `BeginCapture` → one d2d `Copy(dst, src)` → `EndCapture`.
4. `Replay` → `dst` reads back A. Proves the graph ran.
5. **Mutate `src` in place (same address) to B, `Replay` → `dst` must read B.**
   The load-bearing assertion: replay re-executes the captured copy over the
   persistent buffer rather than replaying a snapshot, which is how a decode
   graph picks up each new token's inputs, and the failure `rocm_backend.hip`'s
   `stays FALSE` note warns about.
6. Handle variant: `EndCaptureGraph` → `ReplayGraph` → `DestroyGraph`, same
   A-then-B assertion — that is the path decode graphs actually take.

**RED-first.** The reviewer sees it fail for the intended reason first. Two
mutations that must turn it red, in a scratch copy, restored byte-for-byte:
- `ReplayGraph` a no-op → step 4 fails.
- `EndCaptureGraph` snapshots `src` into a temporary and replays from that →
  step 4 passes, **step 5 fails**. If step 5 survives this, the test is not
  testing the thing it exists for.

## 7. Gates

1. **Build.** Clean `-Werror`, 0 warnings, HIP build on gfx1200. Non-HIP CPU
   build still object-compiles the test file and full `ctest` stays green.
2. **`ctest -R 'rocm|cross_device'`** — the existing 3 binaries plus the new
   case. Baseline on this board is 3/3.
3. **Correctness — the gate that can actually bite.** Re-run the Qwen3-0.6B
   real-oracle battery from
   [rocm-gfx1200-m2-correctness.md](rocm-gfx1200-m2-correctness.md) with capture
   ON. Qwen3 has a decode-graph sibling, so capture changes its execution path,
   and its `'The capital of france is'` prompt is a known, measured,
   version-sensitive near-tie: our CPU and ROCm backends already disagree, and
   two real vLLM builds disagree with each other. A captured graph could move it
   again. **Required outcome is an honest report, not a specific token** — re-run
   the same real-oracle comparison that resolved it before and state what it
   does. A flip the oracle also produces is not a regression; a silent one is.
   **MET in W2, on four models rather than the one required.** Capture changed
   nothing on any of them, byte-for-byte:

   | Model | Path | capture OFF (`VLLM_CPP_CUDAGRAPH=0`) | capture ON |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Qwen3-0.6B | dense | `' 1000000'` | identical |
   | Qwen3-1.7B | dense | `' Paris. 1. What is the capital of France? 2. What'` | identical, 16/16 |
   | Qwen3-4B | dense | `' in which country? The capital of France is in France. But wait, that'` | identical, 16/16 |
   | Qwen3.5-0.8B | GDN hybrid | `':\nA. Paris\nB. London\nC. London\nD.'` | identical, 16/16 |

   The OFF runs are a real negative control, not an assumption:
   `VLLM_CPP_CUDAGRAPH=0` reports `0 total replays across 0 captured size(s)`
   while the ON runs report a capture and a non-zero count, so the two arms
   genuinely differ in execution path.

   Qwen3-0.6B's value is unchanged from the pre-W1 figure this spec's sibling
   record already had, so there is no flip to explain, silent or otherwise.
   Qwen3.5-0.8B is the stronger signal and was not in the original plan: it runs
   the GDN stack, so capture wraps a far larger kernel surface than the dense
   path, and it is still exact. Gemma-3-1B is NOT a check here — it has no
   decode-graph class (`grep -rln DecodeGraph src/vllm/model_executor/models/`),
   so capture cannot reach it.

   **Against the oracle:** in the production configuration AGENTS.md mandates as
   the honest denominator, our ROCm agrees with the pinned oracle EXACTLY on
   this prompt — `' 1000000'`, ids `[220, 16, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15]`. That
   agreement is real but must not be oversold; see the 2x2 below, which shows
   the oracles do not have one answer to agree with.

   **The full 2x2 was then measured, and it refutes the obvious explanation.**
   [rocm-gfx1200-m2-correctness.md](rocm-gfx1200-m2-correctness.md) concludes
   "the real reference implementation does not agree with itself across its own
   versions", without recording the graph configuration of its oracle runs
   (`grep -i 'eager\|cudagraph\|graph'` over that file returns nothing). The
   tempting reading — that its VERSION disagreement is really CAPTURE CONFIG —
   was written down as a hypothesis with its outcomes pre-registered, then
   tested by pulling the tier-1 image
   (`rocm/vllm:rocm7.13.0_gfx120X-all_ubuntu24.04_py3.13_pytorch_2.10.0_vllm_0.19.1`,
   `vllm 0.19.1+rocm7.13.0rc2`) and running both builds both ways. **The
   hypothesis is WRONG.** Same board, same prompt, same greedy settings:

   | Build | `enforce_eager=True` | `enforce_eager=False` (production) |
   |---|---|---|
   | vLLM 0.19.1 | `' 1000000'` | `' Paris, and the capital of the United'` |
   | vLLM `555967922` (pin) | `' Paris. The capital of the United States'` | `' 1000000'` |

   Perfectly ANTI-SYMMETRIC. Both builds flip on capture config, in OPPOSITE
   directions, so version and capture config are independent contributors and
   neither reduces to the other. The sibling record's version framing therefore
   STANDS — and is in fact understated, because the same build also disagrees
   with itself. Reproduced: 3/3 on the 0.19.1 graphs-on cell, and the pin's
   graphs-on cell repeats.

   The load-bearing consequence for us: **our ROCm output is capture-INVARIANT
   where both real vLLM builds are not.** Ours is `' 1000000'` in all
   configurations; each oracle changes answer when its graph mode changes. On
   this prompt our implementation is the more stable of the three, which is a
   fact about a 0.07-logit near-tie rather than a quality claim — but it does
   mean gate 3 cannot be framed as "we match the oracle": there is no single
   oracle answer to match.

4. **`VT_DECODE_GRAPH_STATS=1`** must show a non-zero replay count, proving
   capture engaged rather than falling through to eager — otherwise gate 5's
   numbers are meaningless.

   **MET in W2.** Qwen3-0.6B, 4 prompts / 32 output tokens each:

   ```text
   [Qwen3DenseDecodeGraph] captured dense decode graph for padded size S=1 (real B=1)
   [Qwen3DenseDecodeGraph] dense decode graph: 123 total replays across 1 captured size(s)
   ```

   Qwen3.5-0.8B likewise captures and replays
   (`[DenseDecodeGraph] Qwen3.5 dense decode graph: 6 total replays`). D1's
   pre-warm mitigation therefore holds against a REAL model, not just the W1
   micro-test: the captured region contains every projection GEMM and none of
   them hit `hipMalloc`/`hipFree`/`hipblasCreate` mid-capture.
5. **Performance, measured against a pre-registered prediction.** Re-run §1 on
   all three sizes, same-binary A/B (capture ON vs `VLLM_CPP_CUDAGRAPH=0`), idle
   box, reproduced 2-3x per AGENTS.md. Written down before the work so it cannot
   be retrofitted:

   | Model | Today | Predicted with capture |
   |---|---|---|
   | Qwen3-0.6B | 2.99x | ~1.36x |
   | Qwen3-1.7B | 1.90x | ~1.36x |
   | Qwen3-4B | 1.46x | ~1.36x |

   The load-bearing shape is **convergence**: capture removes the size-dependent
   term, so all three should land together. That is stronger evidence than any
   single number. 4B has the least room to move and is the weakest individual
   signal but the best convergence check. A result materially short of the
   prediction is a finding to record, not one to bury — it would mean the
   fixed-overhead term is smaller than the fit implies, and redirect to D4.
   **Do not describe any outcome as parity**; ~1.36x is the predicted floor for
   this change alone.
6. **`GetReferenceTierHits()` == 0** in any perf measurement — structurally
   impossible on a discrete board, assert anyway.
7. **Records green:** `agent-preflight.sh --staged`, `check-agent-record.py`,
   `check-doc-checkpoint.py`, `check-public-doc-tables.py`,
   `check-device-leakage.py` (this adds no shared-layer device predicate; the
   ratchet must not move).

## 8. Risks and decisions

**D1 — `LtWorkspace` can `hipMalloc` mid-capture; the most likely way this
fails.** `LtWorkspace()` in `rocm_matmul_hipblaslt.hip` allocates the hipBLASLt
workspace lazily in the GEMM path, growing on demand (`if (need > cap) {
hipFree; hipMalloc; }`). Allocation inside a capture region is illegal and
invalidates it. CUDA's contract comment names exactly this — the "NO
cudaMalloc/cudaFree inside the region" bullet in `cuda_backend.cu` — and notes
cuBLASLt's workspace is a one-time per-context alloc there. *Mitigation:*
the decode-graph pre-warm runs the same shapes at the same padded size before
capture, which should grow `cap` to its high-water mark. *If it does not:*
`hipStreamEndCapture` fails loudly rather than corrupting — the acceptable
direction. **W1 verifies this rather than trusting it**; a shape appearing only
at capture time would be a latent, board-specific trap.

**VERIFIED in W1 on gfx1200, and it is worse than written above — there are TWO
lazy initialisations, not one.** Capturing a cold `MatmulBT` ([1,2048] x
[2048,2048]^T) fails with all three of:

```text
vt rocm: hipMalloc: operation not permitted when stream is capturing
vt rocm: hipFree:   operation not permitted when stream is capturing
vt rocm: matmul: hipblasCreate: hipblas 6 (INTERNAL_ERROR)
```

`hipblasCreate` was not anticipated: the handle initialises on first use in the
same path, so a pre-warm must cover **handle creation as well as workspace
growth**. Both fail loudly; neither corrupts. Running the identical GEMM once
beforehand clears both, and the captured graph then replays numerically correct
(0.409606 vs 0.409600 expected, f32). Pinned by `ROCm backend: a pre-warmed GEMM
captures and replays` in `test_rocm_backend.cpp`, which asserts the MITIGATION
rather than the hazard — a future capture-safe allocator would be an
improvement, and a test forbidding it would ratchet the wrong way.

*Consequence for W2:* the decode-graph pre-warm must reach every GEMM shape the
captured region will execute, including the first call that creates the handle.
A shape reached only under capture still aborts, so W2's gate 4 replay count is
what proves the pre-warm was complete.

**D2 — the Qwen3-0.6B near-tie may move.** Covered by gate 3. Separate because
it is the one outcome that could look like a regression while being nothing of
the kind, and quietly re-baselining a golden is what "never weaken a checker"
exists to stop.

**D3 — gfx12 is new silicon, its kernels still maturing upstream.**
vllm-project/vllm#45916 is open, and the oracle's log on this board printed
"Cannot use ROCm custom paged attention kernel, falling back to Triton". It
captured graphs anyway — but around *its* attention path, not ours. Our native
`rocm_paged_attn.hip` inside a capture region is the unproven combination.
*Mitigation:* W2 captures a real Qwen3 decode step, not just the W1 micro-test;
`hipStreamCaptureModeThreadLocal` turns any illegal op into a loud failure.

**D4 — the attribution is evidenced, not profiled.** §1's scaling result is real
evidence, and its refit history is a standing warning against treating the fit
as settled. But no same-tool trace (`rocprof` both sides) isolates launch
overhead from everything else capture changes. Until one does, "capture recovers
~1.6x at 0.6B" is a calibrated prediction, not a measured attribution: W4 says
"consistent with", not "because of". The residual alpha ~= 1.36x is not claimed
as a floor — it is the next thing to attack.

**D5 — one board, one arch.** gfx1200 only. hipGraph is not arch-specific and
the four #41 boards are likelier-supported RDNA3/CDNA parts, but none has run
this. Records say gfx1200; the other boards stay `PENDING-community` exactly as
the W1 approach-(b) delta does today.

**D6 — `DestroyGraph`/`EndCapture` `Check()` the destroy where CUDA silently
ignores it.** `rocm_backend.hip`'s `DestroyGraph` and the prior-`exec_` destroy
inside `EndCapture` both `Check()` `hipGraphExecDestroy`'s return and throw on
failure; the CUDA leg ignores it. Destroying (or recapturing over) an exec still
in flight would throw on HIP where CUDA would succeed silently. Not a W1 defect
— the model-level path is not engaged (`support_static_graph_mode()` is false
until W2), and W1's tests always `Synchronize` before destroying or recapturing.
Found in the W1 review (`review-rocm-decode-graph-w1.md`, INFO-1).

*Consequence for W2:* the decode-graph class must synchronize before destroying
or recapturing an exec on HIP — a teardown or column-change recapture that races
an in-flight replay is exactly the case this asymmetry would surface as a thrown
`Check()` instead of a silent no-op.

## 9. Work breakdown

- **W0 — DONE.** [#332](https://github.com/mudler/vllm.cpp/issues/332) filed and
  carried in the intake table and this header; this spec committed. No code.
- **W1 — backend seam + micro-test.** §5 port map, §6 test, RED-first. Verify D1
  with a capture around a GEMM. *Gate: 1, 2, 7.*
- **W2 — DONE.** `support_static_graph_mode()` overridden true in
  `platforms/rocm.cpp`, mirroring `rocm.py:1001-1002` (unconditional `True`,
  same shape as `cuda.py:662`, against `interface.py:1191`'s `False` default).
  One line of product code and one assertion; no model-level edit was needed,
  which is the seam claim in §2 holding up. Gates 3 and 4 met above, on
  Qwen3-0.6B AND Qwen3.5-0.8B. *Gate: 3, 4.*
- **W3 — measure against the prediction.** Gate 5 + 6, all three sizes,
  same-binary A/B, idle box, 2-3x reproduced. Convergence is the result, not any
  single ratio. Record a miss as readily as a hit.
- **W4 — records.** This spec's `## Outcome`, `backend-matrix.md`,
  `docs/ROCM.md` §5 M3, `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` if gate 5 yields an accepted
  measurement, `NOW.md` if the row's lifecycle state moves.

## 10. Stop conditions

Return `NEEDS_DECISION` rather than improvising if:
- Gate 3 shows a Qwen3-0.6B token change the real oracle does **not** reproduce
  — a genuine correctness signal, not a near-tie, and it stops the work.
- D1 needs a real allocator change (pre-warm hook, workspace cap) — that widens
  scope from porting a seam into shared-allocator surgery.
- Gate 5 lands materially short: concretely, if Qwen3-0.6B does not fall below
  **~2.2x** (under half the predicted ~1.63x recovery), W3 stops and D4's
  profiling becomes the next spec rather than iterating blind here. The
  threshold is fixed in advance so it is a stop condition, not a judgement call
  made after seeing the number.

Return `NEEDS_CONTEXT` if the W0 issue cannot be filed (no work without one).
